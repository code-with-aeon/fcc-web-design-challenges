            </header>
            <p>Adobo is a culinary tradition that embodies the essence of Filipino cuisine. Originating from the Spanish word "adobar," meaning "to marinate," adobo is a cooking method that involves marinating meat in a savory mixture, typically consisting of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and spices. This method of cooking allows the flavors to penetrate the meat, resulting in a tender and flavorful dish.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meat</strong>: Adobo is traditionally made with chicken or pork, but variations can include beef, duck, or even vegetables. The choice of meat affects the flavor and texture of the dish.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Flavor Components</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong>: This salty and savory sauce is a fundamental ingredient in adobo, providing a deep umami flavor. It also contributes to the dish's rich brown color.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vinegar</strong>: Typically, cane vinegar or white vinegar is used. The acidity balances the saltiness of the soy sauce, giving adobo its signature tangy taste.</li>
                    <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Minced garlic adds aromatic depth and enhances the overall flavor profile of the dish. It's often sautéed with the meat at the beginning of the cooking process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Onion</strong>: Sliced or diced onions add sweetness and complexity to the flavor. They are usually cooked with the garlic to create a fragrant base for the dish.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Aromatics and Seasoning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bay Leaves</strong>: These leaves infuse the dish with a subtle earthy flavor. They are usually added during cooking and removed before serving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Black Peppercorns</strong>: Whole peppercorns add a hint of spice and complexity to the flavor. They can be adjusted according to personal preference.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Other Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Water</strong>: Used to create the sauce, water is typically added to the marinating mixture and during the cooking process to ensure the meat stays tender and juicy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Potatoes (Optional)</strong>: Potatoes can be added to the dish for added texture and flavor. They absorb the savory sauce and make the dish heartier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard-Boiled Eggs (Optional)</strong>: Hard-boiled eggs are sometimes added to adobo, providing additional protein and a unique texture that complements the rich sauce.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <p>These ingredients are often combined and simmered together, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully.
